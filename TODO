  - Individual simulation:
    - Get resampling for CIs working
    - Make function for length of stay
    - See if works for clock-forward
  - Make cohort simulation for calculating cohort probabilities (using things like accepting list of flexsurv models and doing all the converting, so the web front end is just that)
